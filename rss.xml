            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five Four + Marvel Collection</h1><p>Some comic book apparel can end up juvenile, but the new Five Four collaboration with Marvel is anything but.

Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
